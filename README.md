# SharePwn
A tool for auditing SharePoint security settings and identifying common security holes.

###Features:###
* Service Discovery
* Version Identification
* User Enumeration
* System/Machine Account Discovery

### Known Issues: ###
* Changing Target/Port while in sharepwn.py does not succesfully change the target specification.
For now, sharepwn.py must be restarted to change target.
* People Enumeration is not fully functional, as I need to stand up a testing environment in order to finish
some of the details.

### Short Term Development TO-DO items: ###
* Better error handling
* Input Sanitization
* Code Clean-up
* Finish People Enumeration Functionality
