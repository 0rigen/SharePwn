To-do Items:
Create an Authentication class/object to maintain auth settings during runtime
Create a session when doing the initial SP identification when users set their target
Modify (Recreate) the session when authentication gets reconfigured
 - If authentication is in an object, my calls only need an: "If session is null, then authenticate"
Identify common workflows or commonalities between services and implement as Interface, if py supports it
